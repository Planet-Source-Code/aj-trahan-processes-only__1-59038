## Processes ONLY


</div>

### Description

After getting sick and tired of being sick and tired of looking for something that demonstrated this, I decided to make it myself. This lists all processes running. It also demonstrates how to 'stop processes' that are running. That's it. I've commented every line needed and I hope this helps someone.

Enjoy!!
